#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook

# This playbook demonstrates how to create a network, subnet and router on the
# Catalyst Cloud. Ansible will pick up the OpenStack environment variables from
# the operating system if an OpenStack RC file is sourced before running the
# playbook. Alternatively, you can specify the OpenStack authentication
# variables and refer to them when using the os_auth module.

    # parameters.
